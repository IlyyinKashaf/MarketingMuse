## README File Entry 📝

- *Problem Statement*: Marketing departments struggle with extracting actionable insights, targeting audiences, and identifying trends.
- *Solution*: Fine-tuned a Tiny T5 model (SLM) for marketing insights generation.
- *Why SLM?*:
    - Reduced cost compared to LLMs
    - Can run on CPU, no GPU required
    - Requires less data for fine-tuning
    - Faster inference and deployment
- *Model Details*:
    - casual model (Encoder only) architecture
    - phase 1 Fine-tuned on non-instructional domain specific dataset for marketing domain
    - phase 2 trained on instrctional data for task specific data 
    - phase 3 trained on human preffered dataset using dpo technique  
    - made zip file of both base_model + lora adopters because of resources constraints, single task, simpe deployement.
    - to prevent data leakage split dataset manually into train (80%), test (10%), validation (10%)
    because custom data does not have pre-built in splitter 
- **Steps followed**
    - load dataset
    - split into train,test,validate
    - preprocess dataset
    - chunking 
    - tokenization
    - data collator 
    - defined model parameters 
    - lora config 
    - phase 1 training 
    - combine base model + phase 1 = train on second phase dataset 
    - combined models with adapters applied DPO with new lora by frezzing previous lora 
    - trained 
    - saved (define directory and file name (zip file))
    - inference pipline 
    - eveluation 


- *Key Learnings*:
    - Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
    - Encoder-Decoder architecture and applications, working 
    - Tokenization, embeddings, and masking techniques
    - Lora and qlora 
    - quantization 
    - how to use model (base+lora = zip file or only adapter(zip) and preloaded base model)
    - data leakage techniques
    - evaluation metrics 
    - benchmarks , evaluation metricss
    - for this used summarization benchmarks (rouge , rouge-L, bert score)
    - production piplines (inference: input , output format and handling datatypes)
    - overfitting and techniques for prevention (learning rate, lora rank, weights, diverse dataset, earlt stoping, droup outs)
    - Adapter Storage
    - Version Control
    - Swapping 
    one model different ADAPTERS switch it based on specific task 
    - deployment servers 
    - data drift 
- *Challenges*:
    - Adapting model to marketing-specific terminology
    - Training it in 3 phases and handling data according to the need of model for specific phase 
- *Outcomes*:
    - Model generates actionable marketing insights
    - Identifies target audience and trends
    - Supports content creation decisions
- *Business Impact*:
    - *Efficiency*: automates insight generation, saving 10+ hours/week
    - *Revenue growth*: targeted content increases engagement by 20%
    - *Data-driven decisions*: actionable insights inform marketing strategies
- *Explaining to Stakeholders*:
    - "This model helps marketing teams extract valuable insights from data, identify trends, and target audiences more effectively."
    - "By automating insight generation, we can increase efficiency and drive revenue growth."
